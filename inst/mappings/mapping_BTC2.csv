The main difference between MSA and BII is that every unit of land is given equal weight in MSA, whereas BII gives more weight to species-rich areas.;Biodiversity|BII;unitless;100;additional mapping taken from additional_NAVIGATE, additional_NAVIGATE category: SDG;M;

Terrestrial Biodiversity|Mean Species Abundance;%;3;Terrestrial biodiversity measured in Mean Species Abundance (MSA);An indicator of naturalness or biodiversity intactness. It is defined as the mean abundance of original species relative to their abundance in undisturbed ecosystems. An MSA (Mean Species Abundance) of 0 % means a completely destructed ecosystem, with no original species remaining. An MSA of 100 % indicates an undisturbed ecosystem, in which species abundance is comparable to the natural state.;;;;;;
